Optimising the Global Mean Variance Portfolio (Lasso and Ridge applications)

# Abstract
In this paper we discuss the foundations of Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the
relevant mathematical equations describing it and contemporary approaches to asset allocation.
We build a Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) based on MPT with a comprehensive
dataset containing daily returns of 48 industries from 1926 to 2017. The computation of the
variance and weights of this portfolio is discussed, considering both long and short positions.
Subsequently, Ridge and Lasso regularisation schemes are applied when minimising the
portfolio’s variance, to better understand the effects of varying regularization parameters. Finally,
GMVP’s performance is analysed in an unregularized case where short selling is prohibited.
